Course Description:
Managerial   perspective   of   the   operations   and   quality   functions, use   of   analytical   tools   to solve operations and quality problems.
Prerequisite:
BUSAD 264 or MATH   156
Course Objectives/Instructional Methods:
Operations Management deals with all activities necessary to transform. inputs into outputs effectively and efficiently. Inputs include all materials, labor,   capital that   are   then transformed into outputs that customers want. The transformation process could include   manufacturing processes or service delivery systems.
The purpose of   this course is to familiarize the student with terminology, concepts, issues,   techniques, and   methodologies   associated   with   the   discipline   of   production/operations   management. Particular emphasis will be placed on operations strategy and   on the   design   and execution of   operations planning and control systems. Attention will be   given to developing analytical skills relevant to the management of   such systems.
The   textbook   is   the   main   source   of   knowledge   for   this   course. Homework   problems should be attempted as a learning activity. Application Exercises (AE)   and   exams   are   graded learning activities.
Credit Hours and Expected Student Effort:
3   Credits
Over   15 weeks, the student will “meet” with the instructor for 7.5 hours   (375   minutes)   and   will be expected to spend an average of   7 hours   (350 minutes) per week   or   105 hours (6,300 minutes) per semester researching and producing a substantial paper or project, or   engaging in an internship and writing a paper about their experience.
Important Dates
Students may drop courses before   15% of   the course duration has passed from your registration   date, without   a   record   of   the   dropped   course   appearing   on   the   student’s   permanent   record.
When   a   student   withdraws   from   a   course   before   75%   of   the   course   duration   has   passed,   a   grade   of   “W”   (withdrawal) will be recorded on the academic record.

Course Requirements:
Homework:
The ability to solve the types of   problems found in this   course is   a   skill,   which   is   best   learned      by DOING. You should attempt all the problems assigned. If   you   need help,   call   or   e-mail   the   instructor. If   a   solution is not correct, a   suggestion will be made   to   correct   the   mistake.   You   do not need to submit these assigned problems. Homework will not be graded nor will it count   toward your grade. In many of   the chapters, numerical problems at the   end   of   the   chapters   are    assigned as practice for the exams. The answers for   even numbered problems   can be   found   in      Appendix V starting on page A8 at the end of   the text.   Additional   hints   and   solutions   for   all   problems are attached to this syllabus. Complete   solutions   are   found in   Blackboard   in   the   documents   section, within   the   exam   folders. Many   of   these   problems   require   the   use   of   tables    and graphs. Refer to the Tables and Graphs section   later   in   this   syllabus   for   instructions   on   the   number   of   copies   you   should   make   of   each   table   or   graph.
Exams, Quizzes, and   Projects:Application Exercises (AE) are   18 short activities to be   submitted   for grading.   There   are   4   exams covering different topics. Once an exam   or AE is   submitted   and   graded,   rework   for   an improved grade is not possible. Before grading, the submitted work   can   be   redone   and      resubmitted with no grading penalty.
Use of   Technology:
Access to Blackboard is required. If   you are not able to access the internet,   submission   of AE’s and exams can be accomplished via   mail.
Print-based students: You will receive all additional resources that are   duplicates   of internet resources along with your course syllabus and access   to   Blackboard   is not necessary.
Attendance/Participation:Because this is an independent study course, you have greater flexibility and choice   in how   you   schedule   your   time   in   completing   this   class.   However,   the   nature   of this   course   also   means that the readings   and written   assignments   are vital   and   must   be   done   in   a   complete   and   timely   fashion.   My   primary   goal   is   to   make   this   course   interesting,   relevant,   and   rewarding.
Extra Credit: Not available.
